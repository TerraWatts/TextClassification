The Prestige is about the romance of the inexplicable. It's out to arouse in us the very human desire to believe in what we cannot see, hear or comprehend. Writer-director Christopher Nolan and his brother and co-writer, Jonathan, are working from a story by British novelist Christopher Priest - a specialist when it comes to the power of illusion - and they've crafted a very tricky picture. The novel begins in the present then flashes back to Victorian London, the setting for most of the action, which centres on the rivalry between two stage magicians. The film prefers to junk the contemporary subplot and plunge straight into the main event. Nonetheless, there's still a lot of time-shifting, for the Nolans ( Memento) are accomplished illusionists in their own right and the plot moves backwards and forwards with the smoothness of a sliding door. To help steer us through, there is Michael Caine, an actor who now looks and sounds as if he has cracked every secret that life has at its disposal. He's cast as Cutter, who has worked for years as a magician's ingeneur - the backstage genius who helps to design and execute the tricks that unfold so seamlessly onstage. And it's he who initiates us into the conventions of the art. As he explains in an introductory voice-over, the classic trick is like a well-made play in having three acts. The first is called the Pledge and presents something that seems ordinary enough. Next comes the Turn, which transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary. And finally, there is the Prestige, which offers suspense, shock and an astonishing twist containing some eternally intriguing enigma. The film, too, is designed along these lines. The rivals, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), first meet as young apprentices working for the same magician. A consummate showman, Angier still has much to learn about the magic that underpins his ability to charm an audience, while Borden is the opposite. A Cockney who has grown up on the streets, he's a gifted illusionist, but his gruff manner and taciturn nature alienate the fans. So it's Angier who finds fame first while Borden is still struggling to earn a living on show business's fringes. Around these two characters, the Nolans create an elaborate puzzle of a film, which is unravelled through the pair's diaries as each becomes increasingly determined to decipher the other's professional secrets. Their accounts are intercut and we're treated to alternating points of view, which makes for some very intricate narrative architecture. The strangest digression is a visit that Angier pays to the Colorado Springs laboratory of the inventor Nikola Tesla (a barely recognisable David Bowie rejoicing in playing the mystery man), who's engaged in a vicious competition of his own with Thomas Edison, his fellow pioneer in the transmission of electrical power. The Nolans are clearly doing their best to retain as much as they can of the novel's complexity and there are times when the plot comes perilously close to sagging into incoherence under the weight of its many contrivances. What saves it is the verve of Nolan's direction. It's good to see a filmmaker have such fun being clever while swimming in the mainstream. This is a big, seductive film. You catch the grubby allure of London by gaslight and the excitements of backstage life and Jackman and Bale look convincingly at home in it all. Jackman gradually reveals the obsessiveness that lies beneath the surface of Angier's easygoing sophistication, while Bale's Borden hums with the undischarged anger of someone who really knows how to hold a grudge. These two do have emotional lives. Several women take on the frustrations of trying to get them to concentrate on something other than their next vanishing trick. The most successful is Scarlett Johansson, who makes smart, sexy work of the part of Olivia, the stage assistant loved - and exploited - by both men. Piper Perabo is not as lucky as Angier's wife, Julia, who makes an early exit, perishing in a stunt gone wrong. But I liked Rebecca Hall - poignant in the under-written role of Borden's put-upon wife, Sarah, who wonders whether his professed passion for her is as much an illusion as everything else which fascinates him. Neither man is exactly easy to love but that's the point of the exercise. It's a very cool piece of filmmaking - as it has to be, given the intellectual sleight-of-hand that lies at its heart. Yet it succeeds as both great entertainment and an absorbing rumination on the dangers of playing God.
